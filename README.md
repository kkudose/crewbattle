# Crew Battle

 An easy way to organize a crew battle, i.e. team-based tournament with a shared pool of life/stock. I think it originated from the [Super Smash Bros.](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Crew_battle) scene, but I was introduced to the concept from a tiny indie game, [SpyParty](http://www.spyparty.com/).

There's another helper tool at [/wildcards](https://crewbattle.pages.dev/wildcards) that's specific to SpyParty.

## But actually:

I enjoyed using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) with [my other project](https://github.com/kkudose/hades), so 
I wanted to continue exploring. This time, I added [Carbon Components Svelte](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-svelte) instead of writing completely custom CSS.

To run locally, install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
